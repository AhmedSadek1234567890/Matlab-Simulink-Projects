# Matlab-Simulink-Projects
This repository contains a collection of MATLAB and Simulink projects for learning and experimenting with control systems, signal processing, robotics, and mechatronics applications. Each project is built step by step with simulation models, block diagrams, and explanations to help students and engineers understand system design and implementation.
